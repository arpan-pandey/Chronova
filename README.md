# Chronova

Chronova is a fictional startup brand developed as part of our college entrepreneurship/project coursework. The aim was to conceptualize, design, and present a realistic and marketable watch business from scratch — focusing on branding, target audience, product design, and marketing strategies.

### Project Overview

Chronova stands for Chrono (time) + Nova (new) — representing a "new era of time". The project is built around the idea of launching a modern, minimalistic, and affordable wristwatch brand tailored for the youth and young professionals who value aesthetics, reliability, and individuality.

The project covers:

    Homepage
        (logo, name, slogans, slider, watch types showcase, fake awards showcase)

    Products page
        (will contain: AI products, hypothetical names and prices)

    Blog page
        (will contain: hypothetical goals and motives, story behind latest products)

    About page
        (creators and pages they created, dedicated CV section, about the company, feedback form)

    Reviews page
        (will contain: fictional reviews of fictional people)

    Research page
        (dedicated page that shows design references, process of how the AI images were made and customized)
